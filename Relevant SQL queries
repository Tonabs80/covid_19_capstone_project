a. Retrieve the cumulative counts of confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases.

SELECT
  SUM(confirmed) AS total_confirmed,
  SUM(deaths) AS total_deaths,
  SUM(recovered) AS total_recovered
FROM
  covid_table
GROUP BY
  province,
  country;

b. Extract the aggregate counts of confirmed, deceased, and recovered cases for the first quarter of each observation year.


SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM observationdate) AS year,
   EXTRACT(QUARTER FROM observationdate) As quarter,
    SUM(confirmed) AS quarter_confirmed,
    SUM(deaths) AS quarter_deaths,
    SUM(recovered) AS quarter_recoveries
FROM covid_table
GROUP BY year, quarter
ORDER BY year, quarter;

c. Formulate a comprehensive summary encompassing the following for each country: Total confirmed cases, Total deaths, Total recoveries.


SELECT
    Country,
    SUM(confirmed) AS total_confirmed,
    SUM(deaths) AS total_deaths,
    SUM(recovered) AS total_recoveries
FROM covid_table
GROUP BY Country;

d. Determine the percentage increase in the number of death cases from 2019 to 2020.


SELECT
    2020 AS year,
    (SUM(deaths) - (SELECT SUM(deaths) FROM covid_table WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM observationdate) = 2019)) / (SELECT SUM(Deaths) FROM covid_table WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM observationdate) = 2019) * 100 AS percentage_increase
FROM covid_table
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ObservationDate) = 2020;

e. Compile data for the top 5 countries with the highest confirmed cases.


SELECT
    Country,
    SUM(confirmed) AS total_confirmed
FROM covid_table
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY total_confirmed DESC
LIMIT 5;

f. Calculate the net change (increase or decrease) in confirmed cases on a monthly basis over the two-year period.


SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', observationdate) AS month,
  SUM(confirmed) - LAG(SUM(confirmed), 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', observationdate)) AS net_change_confirmed
FROM covid_table
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
